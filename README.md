<h1 align="center" id="title">Home Automation &amp; Security Control</h1>



<p id="description">Home Automation has been on the rise in the past few years. Now all things are controlled by IoT ever evolving technology there have been smarter and more advanced solutions in the domain of home automation. To enhance the standard of living the appliances need to be wholly automated without any user intervention in any form whatsoever. This enables the end user hassle-free interaction with the appliances as the appliances learn and react as per the user's requirements without him physically pressing a button. Thus the importance of wireless sensor node has been on the rise and is a critical factor for efficient implementation of home automation.</p>
